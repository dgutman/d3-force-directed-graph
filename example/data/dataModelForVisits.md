## Basic Data Format

Each Note can have multiple properties that we want to graph, as well as other properties that are useful to display, 
but not necessarily part of the graph... 

EncounterDateTime    <<Either a javascript Date Object OR it may be a String like 2016-08-05T13:30 >>  
DocumentName   <STRING>  This is the Note Title  
DocumentID     <INT>   This is a unique number for every document in the database  
ParentDocumentID  <INT>   This may be a -1 or None or not defined if there is no parent, otherwise it's an INT  
                          

    print "HELLO WORLD"
